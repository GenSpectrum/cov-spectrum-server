# Getting Started

The simplest way to start a (local) instance of the CoV-Spectrum server is using Docker and Docker-Compose:

1. Instantiate a database and populate it with data according to the guidelines in [./database.md](./database.md)
2. Fill out the empty values in [docker-compose.yml](../docker-compose.yml)
3. Run `docker-compose up`
